Tervania is a pretty cool mod, it adds souls for every enemy as a special drop. Only hostile NPCs will drop souls.
There are 3 different types of souls that can be dropped and equipped for special effects.

-Enchanted Soul-
A passive effect that works just like accessories.

-Bullet Soul-
A one-shot ability that is free to use for the 1st time, but continues to increase in mana cost as used unless you give it time to cooldown.

-Guardian Soul-
A channeled ability that increases in mana cost as you continually use it.

Set the hotkey to the default F in your control settings under mod controls "Tervania Guardian Soul", otherwise you won't be able to use the
Bullet or Guardian soul.

Have fun!!!
